# Ethereum Wallet Generator

This project demonstrates a simple ethereum wallet generator mainly for quick wallet creation during testing.
In the future, this may act as an ethereum cli wallet with readline option.

The wallet generator creates a public key, a mnemonic and a private key.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/mrozdolski/ethereum-wallet-generator.git
```

```shell
npm install
```

To generate a wallet

```shell
node .
```
